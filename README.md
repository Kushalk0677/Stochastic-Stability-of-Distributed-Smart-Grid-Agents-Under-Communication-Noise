# Stochastic Stability of Distributed Smart Grid Agents Under Communication Noise: A Markov Chain Modelling Approach
Reliable coordination among distributed energy resources (DERs) is essential for the stable operation of modern smart grids, yet such coordination increasingly depends on communication channels that are vulnerable to noise, delay, and corruption. This study develops a stochastic process model to quantify how communication noise affects the stability of distributed coordination mechanisms. We formulate agent interactions as a Markov-chain–based decision process in which local control signals may be corrupted during transmission, and we derive analytical conditions for stable consensus as a function of noise intensity and system size. Monte Carlo simulations across multiple population scales validate the theoretical predictions and reveal the presence of critical reliability thresholds beyond which coordinated behavior collapses. Susceptibility and finite-size scaling analyses further identify early-warning indicators of instability in large-scale deployments. Interpreted from a process-modelling perspective, the results provide quantitative reliability margins for distributed control architectures and highlight how communication quality constrains scalable coordination. The framework offers a minimal yet generalizable model for assessing resilience of cyber-physical energy systems under imperfect communication and supports the design of more fault-tolerant distributed grid-control strategies.
